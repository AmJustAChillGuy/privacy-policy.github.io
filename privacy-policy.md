# Privacy Policy for [AsTrazu]

**Last Updated: April 25, 2025**

Thank you for using [AsTrazu]! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data when you interact with our Discord bot. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## What Data Do We Collect?
[AsTrazu] collects the following data to provide its functionality:

- **Message Content**: We process the content of messages in Discord servers to execute prefix commands (e.g., `!cash`, `!play`, `!blackjack`). This is necessary for the bot to recognize and respond to your commands, such as playing music, managing virtual currency, or performing moderation actions.
- **User and Server Information**: We may access user IDs, usernames, and server IDs to process commands (e.g., to identify users for commands like `!marry` or `!ban`) and to ensure the bot functions correctly within Discord servers.
- **Command Usage Data**: We may temporarily log command usage (e.g., which commands are used) to improve the bot’s performance and troubleshoot issues. This data does not include message content and is anonymized.

## How Do We Use Your Data?
The data we collect is used solely to provide the bot’s functionality, including:

- Processing prefix commands to deliver features like:
  - Economy (e.g., `!cash`, `!daily` for managing virtual currency).
  - Gambling (e.g., `!blackjack`, `!slots` for interactive games).
  - Music (e.g., `!play`, `!skip` for music playback).
  - Profile and Social Interactions (e.g., `!marry`, `!hug` for user engagement).
  - Moderation and Utilities (e.g., `!help`, `!userinfo` for server management).
- Ensuring the bot operates correctly across Discord servers.
- Debugging and improving the bot’s performance (using anonymized usage data).

## Do We Store Your Data?
- **Message Content**: We do not store message content. Messages are processed in real-time to execute commands and are not retained after the command is completed.
- **Other Data**: User IDs, server IDs, and anonymized command usage data may be temporarily stored for debugging purposes but are deleted within 30 days. We do not store any personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary for the bot to function.

## Do We Share Your Data?
We do not share your data with any third parties. All data processing occurs within Discord’s ecosystem, and we do not transfer data outside of Discord.

## Do We Use Data for AI or Machine Learning?
No, we do not use your data, including message content, to train AI or machine learning models. Your data is only used to execute commands and improve the bot’s functionality.

## How Can You Opt Out?
You can opt out of having your message content processed by restricting the bot’s access to specific channels or servers. Server admins can use Discord’s permission settings to deny the bot’s ability to read messages in certain channels, ensuring the bot only processes commands where explicitly allowed.

## Your Rights
You have the right to:
- Understand how your data is used (as outlined in this policy).
- Contact us to request information about the data we process (see below for contact details).
- Restrict the bot’s access to your data by adjusting server permissions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and we will notify users through the bot’s support server or via the `!help` command.

## Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, please join our support server [https://discord.gg/4vBzJaaVgv] or email us at [senghongly8828@gmail.com].
