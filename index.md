# Privacy Policy for AsTrazu

**Last Updated: April 30, 2025**

Thank you for using AsTrazu! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you interact with our Discord bot, AsTrazu. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices in compliance with Discord’s Developer Policy.

## What Data Do We Collect?

AsTrazu collects the following data to provide its features and functionality:

- **Message Content**: We process the content of messages in Discord servers to execute prefix commands (e.g., `hug`, `blackjack`, `play`). This is necessary for the bot to recognize and respond to commands for actions, gambling, music, and other features.
- **User and Server Information**:
  - **Server Members Data**: We access user IDs, usernames, nicknames, and avatars to support features like economy (e.g., `cash`, `transfer`), profiles (e.g., `profile`, `description`), matchmaking (e.g., `marry`), and leaderboards (e.g., `leaderboard`). This data is also used to verify roles and manage permissions for certain commands.
  - **Server Data**: We collect server IDs to ensure the bot functions correctly within Discord servers and to associate user data with specific servers (e.g., for economy or leveling systems).
- **Command Usage Data**: We temporarily log anonymized command usage (e.g., frequency of command usage) to monitor bot performance and troubleshoot issues. This does not include message content or personally identifiable information.

## How Do We Use Your Data?

The data we collect is used exclusively to provide and improve AsTrazu’s functionality, including:

- **Processing Commands**:
  - **Prefix Commands**: Reading message content to execute commands like `hug`, `blackjack`, `play`, and `cash` for actions, gambling, music, and economy features.
  - **Slash Commands**: Handling commands like `/deleteaccount` for data management.
- **Feature Delivery**:
  - Economy: Managing virtual currency (e.g., `cash`, `daily`, `transfer`).
  - Gambling: Enabling games like `blackjack`, `slots`, and `coinflip`.
  - Profiles and Social Interactions: Supporting features like `profile`, `marry`, and `hug` using user data (e.g., usernames, avatars).
  - Leaderboards and Levels: Displaying rankings and user progress (e.g., `leaderboard`).
  - Moderation and Utilities: Providing tools like `ban`, `clear`, and `userinfo`.
  - Music: Managing playback with commands like `play`, `skip`, and `queue`.
- **Bot Operation**: Using server and user IDs to ensure commands work correctly across servers.
- **Improvement**: Analyzing anonymized command usage to debug and enhance bot performance.

## Do We Store Your Data?

- **Message Content**: We do not store message content. Messages are processed in real-time to execute commands and are not retained after the command is completed.
- **User and Server Data**:
  - We temporarily store user IDs, usernames, nicknames, avatars, and server IDs to support features like profiles, leaderboards, and economy systems.
  - This data is stored off-platform (outside of Discord) for up to 30 days to ensure functionality (e.g., tracking user balances or levels).
  - All stored data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption, in compliance with Discord’s Developer Policy.
- **Command Usage Data**: Anonymized usage logs are stored for up to 30 days for debugging purposes and then deleted.

## How Can You Request Data Deletion?

You can request the deletion of your data at any time by:

- Running the `/deleteaccount` command in the bot, which will immediately remove all stored data associated with your user ID (e.g., economy balances, profile data).
- Contacting us via our Discord support server: [https://discord.gg/4vBzJaaVGv](https://discord.gg/4vBzJaaVGv).
- Emailing us at: [senghongly8828@gmail.com](mailto:senghongly8828@gmail.com).

Once deleted, your data cannot be recovered.

## Do We Share Your Data?

We do not share your data with any third parties. All data processing occurs within our systems, and we do not transfer data outside of Discord’s ecosystem except for temporary storage as described above.

## Do We Use Data for AI or Machine Learning?

No, we do not use your data, including message content or user information, to train AI or machine learning models. Your data is only used to provide and improve AsTrazu’s functionality.

## How Can You Opt Out?

- **Message Content**: You cannot opt out of message content processing if you use prefix commands, as it is required for the bot to function (e.g., to recognize `hug` or `blackjack`). However, server admins can restrict the bot’s access to specific channels using Discord’s permission settings, preventing the bot from reading messages in those channels.
- **Server Members Data**: You cannot opt out of server members data processing if you interact with features like economy, profiles, or leaderboards, as this data is necessary for those features to work. You can request deletion of your data using the `/deleteaccount` command to stop further processing.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Understand how your data is used (as outlined in this policy).
- Request deletion of your data using the `/deleteaccount` command or by contacting us.
- Restrict the bot’s access to your data by adjusting server or channel permissions (via Discord’s settings).
- Contact us for more information about your data (see contact details below).

## Security of Your Data

We take security seriously:

- All sensitive user data (e.g., usernames, avatars) stored off-platform is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption, ensuring compliance with Discord’s Developer Policy.
- We implement strict access controls to protect your data from unauthorized access.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Changes will be reflected on this page, and we will notify users via our Discord support server or through the bot’s `help` command.
