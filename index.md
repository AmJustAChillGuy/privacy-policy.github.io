User and Server Metadata

We collect the following information to support economy, security, and moderation features:

User IDs, usernames, nicknames, and avatars – for economy profiles, leaderboards, and moderation actions.

Server IDs – to scope user data (balances, settings, security rules) correctly to each server.
