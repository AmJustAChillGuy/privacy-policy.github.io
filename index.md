📌 What Data Do We Collect?

Message Content

Apollo scans message content only in real time to detect and block malicious, phishing, or spam links.

We do not store message content permanently. Once scanned, it is discarded immediately.


User & Server Metadata

To support security features, Apollo may temporarily process:

User IDs, usernames, nicknames, and avatars – for logging suspicious behavior during raids or nukes.

Server IDs – to scope logs and security rules to the correct server.


Security Logs

Apollo may store short-term security logs containing user IDs, server IDs, and event details (e.g., blocked links, detected raid attempts, prevented mass actions).

Stored only for debugging and security audit purposes.

Automatically deleted within 30 days.
