Privacy Policy for AsTrazu

Last Updated: May 06, 2025

Thank you for using AsTrazu! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when interacting with our Discord bot. We are committed to transparency and to respecting your privacy, in full compliance with Discord’s Developer Policy.


---

📌 What Data Do We Collect?

AsTrazu collects and processes only the data required to support its core features. These include:

Message Content
We process message content only to detect and handle prefix-based commands (e.g., Ztransfer, Zdaily, Zkhlakhlouk 100). These messages are required to:

Start gambling games like Khla Khlouk

Handle virtual currency transfers

Process simple commands like Zdaily or Zwork


▶️ We do not store message content. It is processed in real time and discarded immediately after.

User and Server Metadata

User IDs, usernames, nicknames, and avatars — to personalize economy features, profiles, and leaderboards.

Server IDs — to associate user data (coins, activity) with the correct server.


Command Usage Data
We log anonymized data on how often commands are used. This helps us maintain performance and fix issues. No personal or message content is stored in these logs.

⚙️ How Do We Use Your Data?

We only use collected data to operate AsTrazu’s features:

Prefix Command Execution
We process message content only when a user sends a command using a prefix (e.g., Zkhlakhlouk 100, Ztransfer @user 500). This allows the bot to:

Read and respond to user-initiated prefix commands

Provide fast, accessible gameplay and economy tools


Economy & Gambling Features
We store user balance and game status temporarily to support features like:

Khla Khlouk Dice Game

Blackjack, Slots

Coin transfers (Ztransfer), daily rewards, and profile tracking


Bot Performance & Safety
Server and user IDs are used to ensure your settings and balances are properly scoped to your server. Anonymized usage data helps us fix bugs and improve the experience.
